# YouTube Clone

This is a YouTube clone built using React.js, Redux Toolkit, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind. The app fetches data from the YouTube API to display video cards and uses the real YouTube search suggestions API to display working search suggestions. It also features a nested comment section and uses Redux for state management.
